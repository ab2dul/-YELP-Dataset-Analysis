Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.



Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
i. Attribute table = 10000
ii. Business table = 10000
iii. Category table = 10000
iv. Checkin table = 10000
v. elite_years table = 10000
vi. friend table = 10000
vii. hours table = 10000
viii. photo table = 10000
ix. review table = 10000
x. tip table = 10000
xi. user table = 10000
	


2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

select count (distinct id) 
from business
select count (distinct business_id) 
from hours 
select count (distinct business_id) 
from category
select count (distinct business_id) 
from attribute 
select count (distinct id) , count(distinct business_id) , count( distinct user_id)
from review 
select count( distinct business_id)
from  checkin 
select  count(distinct id) , count( distinct business_id)
from photo 
select  count(distinct business_id) , count( distinct user_id)
from tip 
select count(distinct id)
from user 
select count(distinct friend_id) , count(distinct user_id)
from friend 
select count(distinct user_id)
from elite_years


i. Business = 10000
ii. Hours = 1562
iii. Category =  2643
iv. Attribute = 1115
v. Review = id,business_id,review_id (10000,8090,9581)
vi. Checkin = 493
vii. Photo = id,business_id (10000,6493)
viii. Tip = user_id,business_id (537,3979)
ix. User = 10000
x. Friend = friend_id,user_id (9415,11)
xi. Elite_years = 2780

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.	



3. Are there any columns with null values in the Users table? Indicate "yes," or "no."

SQL code used for analysis:

		select city , address , review_count, stars , id , hours
                from business
                INNER join hours ON business.id = hours.business_id
                Where city = 'Las Vegas'
                Group by stars
		
2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1:

Ans: (Location)
         Location is totally different of the business that are still open and the ones that are closed. 
         
ii. Difference 2:
         
Ans: (Stars)
           Stars are totally different of the business that are still open and the ones that are closed. 
         
SQL code used for analysis:

select is_open, id, name, address , stars
from business
Group by is_open 
Order by is_open ASC;	

	
3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:

Ans: I will predict the number of labels a photo have on a particular date.         
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:

Ans: For this analysis I will use two tables one will be photo and the other will be checkin. I want the caption , business_id, photo_id and number of labels on a photo and I will also
     also get the data of the date of checkin by joining business_id from the checkin table. The checkin date identifies date when a business_id is checked in and on particular date we will predict the number of labels a photo got.                           
                  
iii. Output of your finished dataset:


+-----------------+--------------+----------------+------------------------+
| caption         | count(label) | date           | id                     |
+-----------------+--------------+----------------+------------------------+

+-----------------+--------------+----------------+------------------------+


         
         
iv. Provide the SQL code you used to create your final dataset:

    select caption, count(label), date, id
    from photo
    INNER JOIN checkin ON
    checkin.business_id = photo.business_id
    Where date = 'Thursday-20:00'
    Group by caption
    Order by count(label) ASC
